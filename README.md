# BlackJack

A simple game of Blackjack complete with a GUI 

The purpose of this project was to refamiliarise myself with Python and also to learn a new skill in using PyQt5. 
I have only ever worked with Python via terminals and text based output or graphs in the past. 
Working with PyQt5 and learning out to build and use graphical user interfaces in Python was a fun little challene. 


Note: 
The playsound module on macOS needs the AppKit module, which comes from the pyobjc package. If it's not installed, you will get an error.
